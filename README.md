# Angular Express Seed

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, LeanCloud Cloud Code on the back(Express + Node). This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use [LeanCloud Cloud Engine](https://leancloud.cn/docs/leanengine_guide-node.html) to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries, LeanCloud libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.
It also illustrates writing angular partials/views with the ejs templating library.

_Note: Although ejs supports interpolation, you should be doing that mostly on the client. Mixing
server and browser templating will convolute your app. Instead, use ejs as a syntactic sugar for
HTML, and let AngularJS take care of interpolation on the browser side._
